# 4. Determine the chunks to fetch using inverted indexes

### Overview

After querying for all of the ingesters, a querier tries to select flushed chunks using inverted indexes. And then, the chunks are filtered and returned to the query-frontend.

### What is "inverted index"?  Why does Loki use it?

"Inverted index" is also used in fulltext-search engine like Elasticsearch.

This is the data structure, which aims to search logs based on label values efficiently.

In Loki, the log chunks have unique IDs to identify.

The inverted index has the mapping between label key-values and chunk IDs so that we can select the chunks with label keys or values in performant.&#x20;

If Loki doesn't use it, it would spend a lot of times to retreieve large amount of logs.

### Overall Flow to search in querier

1. Identify the target stream IDs by label key-values in query
2. Identify the chunk IDs by the stream IDs and time range in query
3. Download from chunk cache or AWS S3 using the chunk IDs

### The structure of the inverted index

To understand the structure, we need to know "series-id" and "chunk-key".

Series-id is the id of a stream and chunk-key is the unique key of a chunk.

Let me explain more detail.

#### Series ID

The series-id is constructed with the hash value of label name and value pairs.

#### Chunk Key

The chunk key is constructed with the Tenant ID, the hash value of label key and value pairs, chunk created time, and chunk closed time.

#### Inverted Index

In fact, inverted index is managed as a table like DynamoDB.&#x20;

Also, there are some kinds of tables for that and they are for identifying series-ids and chunk keys.

At first, here is the table definition to identify series-ids by label names or label values.

![A table to identify SeriesID by label key-value](<../.gitbook/assets/スクリーンショット 2021-12-28 16.42.49 (1).png>)

It has three columns and its row is the unique with "hash value" and "range value" columns as well as DynamoDB.

We can search with a prefix of the range value and sort the results with it.

An actual table example helps us to understand.

It tells us that each label key-value pair creates each table row.

It means that a high cardinarity label causes too many rows in this table and decreases performance.

Second, here is the table to identify chunk-keys by series-ids.

It is scanned with series-ids, tenant-ids, and time range.

### How to use these structure to select logs

Let's look at an example to understand.

We can query this LogQL to select the logs, which has "keystone" as the service, "host1" as the hostname, and are error level.

```
{service="keystone", hostname="host1"} |= "level=ERROR"
```

How does a querier process it?

At first, the querier splits the query with labels and filter expressions, and then it uses only labels to search logs using the inverted indexes.

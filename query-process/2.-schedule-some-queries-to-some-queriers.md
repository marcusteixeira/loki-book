# 2. Schedule some queries to some queriers

### How query-frontend split and schedule queries

The split queries are enqueued to a request queue by query-frontend.

Some queriers, which are connected to the query-frontend via bidirectional gRPC, get a query and process it.

In addition, a querier creates a goroutine for each query so that it can handle some queries in parallel. When the query is completed, it returned the result to the query-frontend via gRPC.

Here is the overall figure for processing a query.

### Query Scheduler

In 2.4.0 newer version, query-scheduler is released.

This is the component that cuts out the query queue from query-frontend.

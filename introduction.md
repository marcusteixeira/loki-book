# Introduction

Grafana Loki is a great log monitoring platform provided as OSS.

However, it is hard to run in production because it is constructed with many microservices and we can't know how they work easily.

Therefore, I've been investigating for a long time to run in my production environment, which is now 2 TB / a day and aims to be 20 TB / a day.

In this book, I'll provide detail about Loki and I hope that everyone enjoys "Loki Life"!
